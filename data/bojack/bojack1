It is good to be here, Charlie. Sorry I was late. The traffic...
I parked in a handicapped spot, I hope that's okay.
I'm sorry, disabled spot. Is that the... proper... nomenclature?
No, I don't think I should drive right now. I'm-I'm incredibly drunk.
Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview? I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.
Charlie, listen, y'know, I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at the time, I can tell you— Is it okay to say "shit"?
I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it is. It's not Ibsen, sure—but look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra. And sometimes, when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likeable people who love each other. Where, y'know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes... everything's gonna turn out okay. Y'know, because in real life... 
Did I already say the thing about the urethra?
That's a great question, Charlie.
First of all, we're not roommates. You are my houseguest.
You sleep on my couch and you don't pay rent. I've had tapeworms that are less parasitic. I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place.
You told me they didn't approve of your "alternative lifestyle". I thought you were, like, a troubled gay teen or something. I didn't realize by "alternative lifestyle" that you meant you were lazy.
'Neigh way, Jose!' I improvised that line.
Todd, I weigh 1200 pounds. It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk... Yes.
As my agent, do you think I'm getting fat?
And as my ex-girlfriend?
 Wait, so, which pile of crap am I?
 What? That's the worst one!
 Todd, who was that guy? Who are all these people?
 Sorry, I'm better than that.
  Good Lord, that's depressing.
  Responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.
